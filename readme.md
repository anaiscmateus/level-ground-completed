## About

The Level Ground MMA Gym website is designed to provide information about the gym, its programs, and engage with martial arts enthusiasts. It allowed me to explore and implement various web development concepts.

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I gained valuable insights:

- **Float Mastery:** I delved into the use of CSS floats, a technique often employed for creating complex layouts. It helped me understand how to manage the positioning of elements within a webpage effectively.

- **Video Autoplay:** Ensuring video autoplay on both desktop and mobile can be challenging. I learned the importance of `autoplay` and `playsinline` attributes for video elements to achieve this. `autoplay` with `loop` is suitable for desktop, while `playsinline` is crucial for mobile video autoplay.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structuring the content and layout of the website.

- **CSS:** Applying styles and layouts to create an engaging user interface.
